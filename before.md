Before I doing research on ROS, I would try out to design my ROS first.

1. Linux Based
Saving time on the general Operation System design

2. Follow the Three law of Robot Design in Core
    1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
    2. A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
    3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.[1]

3. Moduleization in Mind
4. Mordern Tech Ready
    1. Machine Learning (Tenderflow, Caffe)
    2. ASR/Visial Ready
    3. Machanical Controls
